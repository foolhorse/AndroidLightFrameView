        Inside a broken clock.Splashing the wine.With all the rain dogs.Taxi, we\'d rather walk.Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs.For I am a Rain Dog, too.Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night.For it was all ripe for dreaming.Oh, how we danced away.All of the lights.We\'ve always been out of our minds..The rum pours strong and thin.Beat out the dustman.With the rain dogs.Aboard a shipwreck train.Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs.For I am a Rain Dog too..Oh, how we danced with the.Rose of Tralee.Her long hair black as a raven.Oh, how we danced and you.Whispered to me.You\'ll never be going back home.You'll never be going back home..Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night.For it was all ripe for dreaming.Oh, how we danced away.All of the lights.We\'ve always been out of our minds
